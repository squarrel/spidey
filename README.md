This is a game in the process of creation. It is called Spidey and it is supposed to be about a spider, you, which goes around and tries to catch bugs. It is far from finished and who knows if it's gonna be fun in the end, for now it is coming close to the stage where it'll be playable.

This game uses Kivy, a Python library for apps that use innovative user interfaces and it uses the Kivent game engine.
